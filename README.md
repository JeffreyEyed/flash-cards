# flash-cards 

Made this flash card math app to help my daughter hone her math skills.  
I think I will eventually add to it, to make it better.  
It gives random addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems.
As of now it's numbers 9-0.  It will create a problem with a hidden solution that you need to unhide.
Then try the next one.
